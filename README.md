# Daily Planner

## Description
Daily Planner project consists in modifying a starter code provided for a daily planner so the user can save on a daily basis tasks for that day during business hours (9 AM to 5 PM). The JavaScript file was created using Day.js and jQuery libraries (starter code had 'TO DO' tips inside of a function). The time slots are colored coded according to the current hour (hour in the past - gray; hour in the present - red; hour in the future - green). This project is part of a challenge from Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota.
